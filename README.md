Master repository to store the case studies and the coursework I did during my post graduate diploma in Data Science from IIIT-Bangalore.

The case studies folder has the following content:

2. Eleckart Ecommerce Case Study: Developed a market mix model to observe the actual impact of different marketing variables over the last year and recommend the optimal budget      allocation for different marketing levers for the next year.

A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

8. Letter Image Recognition:

9. Market Industry case study: Using Exploratory Data analysis to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

10. NYC Parking Case Study: Exploratory data analysis using PySpark for NYC parking tickets data to have better parking and fewer tickets.

11. PCS Country Case Study: Categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country i.e; cluster the countries 
    into groups.

13. Telechom Churn Case Study: The objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To reduce customer       churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

14. Uber Supply Demand Case Study: Exploratory Data Analysis is done to identify the root cause of the problem i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars and recommend ways       to improve the situation.
